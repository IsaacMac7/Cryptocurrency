# Cryptocurrency
React-native Coding Challenge.

This is a react-native application that can do the following:
- Display a paginated list of Cryptocurrencires.
- Provide further information of Cryptocurrency selected (7 day, hourly chart).
- Utilizes CoinGecko API for crypto market data.
- Loading state with activity indicator.
- Error state.
- Search Crypto coin by name/symbol.
- Utilizes ESLint + Prettier.
- Installed Jest for testing.

Note:
I have completed 6/7 of the Product Requirements specified in the Coding Challenge.
- Automated testing was not implemented in time. I intend to learn more about automating testing and implement it in the near future.
- I also intend to make the product more dynamic with more functions in the near future (refresh/refetch data, interactive chart, more crypto details/data, etc.).
