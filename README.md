# Cryptocurrency
React-native Coding Challenge.

This is a react-native application that can do the following:
- display a paginated list of Cryptocurrencires
- provide further information of Cryptocurrency selected (7 day, hourly chart)
- utilizes CoinGecko API for crypto market data
- loading state with activity indicator
- search Crypto coin by name/symbol
- utilizes ESLint + Prettier
- installed Jest for testing

Note:
I have completed 6/7 of the Product Requirements specified in the Coding Challenge.
- automated testing was not implemented in time
- i intend to make the product more dynamic with more functions in the near future (refresh/refetch data, interactive chart, more crypto details/data, etc.)
